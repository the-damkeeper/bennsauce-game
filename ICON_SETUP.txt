# Icon Setup

To complete the Electron app setup, you need an icon file.

## Quick Fix
1. Create or find a PNG image for your game icon (512x512 recommended)
2. Save it as `icon.png` in this directory
3. The build process will use it automatically

## Without an Icon
The game will still work! Electron will use a default icon.

## Creating an Icon
- Use your game's logo or a representative image
- Recommended sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Tool suggestion: GIMP (free) or any image editor

For now, the build will work without it, but you'll get a warning.
